## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Rate Limits**: GitHub API has rate limits - for large imports, the tool will respect these limits

- **Issue Creation**: Issues are created in the repository you specify, then added to the project

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**"No accessible projects found"**

- Make sure your token has the `project` scope
- Verify you have access to Projects V2 (not classic projects)

**"Repository not found"**

- Check that your token has `repo` or `public_repo` scope
- Ensure the repository name is correct

**"CSV parsing errors"**

- Make sure your CSV follows the format guidelines
- Use quotes around descriptions containing commas
- Check for proper line endings
